This prototype software contain the Matlab implementation of the temporal and spatiotemporal salient region detection algorithm proposed in the paper
"Discovering Salient Objects from Videos using Spatiotemporal Salient Region Detection".

This prototype software is tested on Matlab 2013b on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions on Windows environment.

Code for the proposed algorithms:

To run the proposed temporal salient region detection approach, please run run_LGT.m
To run the proposed spatiotemporal salient region detection approach, please run run_STS.m

Codes for Faster Variants of the proposed approaches:

To run the faster variants of the proposed approaches FLGT and FSTS, 
Please run the corresponding Matlab codes run_FLGT.m, and run_FSTS.m

Note:
The input video frames are in the directory "Input"
Output saliency map can be found the directory "Output".

Thank You.
